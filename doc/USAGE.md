### Searching

Production solution for searching applications in MVP is to click on "Applications" under desired class name and use browser search function.

### Payment Tiers

When Payment Tier is changed for a class it will apply only to applications that will be submitted after the change. New payment tier has to be applied to existing applications manually, by selecting it under Personal Detail in the application.

This may seem a bit cumbersome, but this is a failsafe feature for a situation when you already have different tiers assigned to existing applications and decide to switch default, to prevent system 'forgetting' previously selected tiers.
